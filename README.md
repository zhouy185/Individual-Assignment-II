# Individual Case Assignment: Check Point II

Due on **November 12, 2025**, end of day

## Overview

This assignment uses data from the Nata Supermarkets: Customer Analytics case.
The dataset contains information about supermarket customers — including their demographics, spending habits across product categories, and how long they’ve been customers.

You will use `plotly.express` to create visualizations based on the data and `streamlit` to create a web-based dashboard.

## What to Do

1. Read the case description (provided separately in the course outline).
It introduces Nata Supermarkets’ business context and explains what each variable in the dataset represents.

2. Open the Colab Notebook
The notebook outlines the details tasks to be completed.

3. Answer each question directly in the notebook

    * Use code cells for your Python code.

    * Use short text cells (Markdown) to answer questions.
  
    * Make sure to **include your name and student number** and **save your colab notebook to Github**. 

## Learning Goals

By completing this assignment to:

* Practice skills in data visualization and dashboarding.

* Develop skills to interpret visualizations into business insights.

## Files Provided

* The customer dataset (to be loaded in the first code cell from a private GitHub repo)
* `Individual_Assignment_2_notebook.ipynb` — your Colab notebook with questions
* `melt_example` for an examole on the `melf` function, which will be useful for creating bar charts.

* README.md — this instruction file

## Submission

Submit to GitHub Classroom before the due date.
Make sure all code cells run correctly and outputs are visible.
Provide the link to your streamlit app
